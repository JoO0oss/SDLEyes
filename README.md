# SDLEyes
Draws eyes that track the mouse cursor, onto a window using SDL2.

<br>


## Build Instructions
### Dependencies
- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/)

### Compile and run

- Using GCC: \
`gcc main.c circle.c -o SDLEyes -lSDL2 -lm`

- Then to run, \
`./SDLEyes` \
 \
 (For simplest use, do this all in the same folder as the code.)


## Disclaimer

The window sitting there with the eyes just following the cursor around is by no means my idea, but the way the pupils follow the mouse around is my own algorithm.
I know this is a fairly popular sort of project but it's a good thing to refer back to for simple things like compiling with libraries or using multiple source files.
